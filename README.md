# Expo React Native Video Sharing App

This project is a video sharing application for mobile devices, built with React Native using Expo. The app's routing is powered by Expo Router, which provides a file-based routing system. For styling, we leverage NativeWind, which brings Tailwind CSS-like utility-first styling into the React Native world. For fluid and responsive animations, React Native Reanimated is utilized.

## Features

- **Expo**: An open-source platform for making universal native apps for Android, iOS, and the web with JavaScript and React.
